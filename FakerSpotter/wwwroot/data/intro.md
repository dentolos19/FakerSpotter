You should have seen multiple posters around the school displaying many tips and tricks on how to identify fake news. But just in case you didn't, expand this to get some few pointers.

##### Distinguish a factual statement

You need to ask yourself these questions in order to determine if it is a factual statement:

* Can the statement **be proved or demonstrated** to be true? 
* Can the statement **be observed in practice** or operation?
* Can you see it happen? _(using common sense)_
* Can the statement **be verified by witnesses**, manuscripts, or documents?

Examples of these factual statements are:

* King John of England signed the Magna Carta in 1215.
* There are 50 states in the United States.
* Beethoven had a reputation as a virtuoso pianist.

##### Distinguish a opinion statement

You should use two types of words to identify opinions:

* **Biased Words** (e.g. bad, worse, worst, good, better, best, worthwhile, worthless)
* **Qualifiers** (e.g. all, always, likely, never, might seem, possibly, probably, should)

There are three common types of opinion statements:

* Positions on controversial issues _(common on headlines)_
* Predictions about things in the future _(common on headlines)_
* Evaluations of people, places, and things

Examples of these opinion statements are:

* To solve traffic, it is better to invest in subways and trains than in road widening programs.
* It is better to live in Singapore than in Japan.
* Dennise is the best programmer in the world.
