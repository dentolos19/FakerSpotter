<summary>During this cyberwellness week, you might have learnt many ways to protect yourself with fake news. But just in case you didn't, expand this to get some few pointers.</summary>

##### Identifying a factual statement

You need to ask following three questions to identify if it is a factual statement.

* Can the statement be proved or demonstrated to be true?
* Can the statement be observed in practice or operation?
* Can you see it happen?
* Can the statement be verified by witnesses, manuscripts, or documents?

##### Identifying an opinion statement

We use two types of words to identify opinions.

* Biased Words (e.g. bad, worse, worst, good, better, best, worthwhile, worthless)
* Qualifiers (e.g. all, always, likely, never, might seem, possibly, probably, should)
