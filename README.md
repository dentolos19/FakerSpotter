## About This Project

FakerSpotter is a digital toolkit for learning on how to protect yourself from fake news. 

We teach players by making them learn from their mistakes and through trial-and-error. The leaderboards was added in order to incite the players with the feeling of competivitiveness and motivation.

This project is participating in the **National Cyberwellness Advocacy Challenge (NCAC)**.

### How To Play

The player needs to answer all questions correctly in order to proceed to the next room. If one answered a question incorrectly, the game will deduct a small amount of points depending on the difficulty of the room and the player will need to retry again until the amount of the room points left is under 100.
